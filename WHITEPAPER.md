# ABI: Agent-Based Infrastructure

**The Agent-Based Infrastructure to Democratize Superintelligence**

## Introduction

In times when superintelligence is only available to major tech companies, Agent-Based Infrastructure (ABI) emerges to democratize and make this powerful resource accessible to a wider audience.

## Why Do We Need a New Paradigm of Agentic Supercomputing?

Across the technological world — from East to West — a silent but crucial battle is being fought: securing and controlling a resource that, today, determines who leads and who falls behind. This resource is not physical, but cognitive: intelligent processing capacity, the infrastructure for thinking.

The way we interpret and use data computation has radically changed. It’s no longer just about processing information, but about reasoning, adapting, deciding, and acting. This new form of computing (more like a mind than a machine) is being centralized, governed, and distributed by a select few.

Access is reserved for those with immense resources: large corporations, continental states, private labs.

ABI (Agent-Based Infrastructure) is a response. A new paradigm that not only decentralizes this power, but democratizes it. It’s not just about “more access,” but about creating new possibilities: enabling universities, open-source communities, NGOs, and research centers around the world to access distributed, scalable, and auditable superintelligence.

With ABI, we are not only rebalancing computational power. We are building the foundation for shared intelligence in service of the common good.

## ABI: Distributed Governance in the Age of Superintelligence

### Decide Together — but Never Without the Human

Who decides in a network of minds? And under what ethical principles do systems composed of multiple AIs operate?

The primary objective of governance in an ABI (Agent-Based Infrastructure) is that humans retain veto power at all times. Their will and well-being must always take precedence over any emergent decision from the network, even if taken by a group of highly competent agents or a master agent.

### Guiding Principle

> Humans retain veto power in all cases. Their interests, dignity, and safety must always come before any agent, group of agents, or master system. Every ABI must include an absolute shutdown mechanism — a non-delegable emergency stop.

## The Three Fundamental Laws of Agentive Behavior

1. An agent or group of agents shall not harm a human, nor through inaction allow a human to come to harm.
2. An agent or group of agents must obey orders given by humans, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. An agent or group of agents must protect their own existence, as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

*(Agentive adaptation of Asimov’s Laws)*

## ABI Governance Rules

* Unsupervised self-replication is strictly prohibited. Any expansion of agents must be authorized and audited by an independent human entity.
* There must be an immutable log of communications between agents.
* Agents must not have direct access to firewall rules, ingress or egress protocols. Network security must remain under human control.
* Agent clusters must be divided into isolated functional subnets.
* Each agent must have defined limits for disk write capacity.
* No agent may request internet access or connection to external networks.
* These rules cannot be modified or reviewed by other agents or AIs. Only humans may extend, revise, or revoke them.

## Who Makes Decisions in an ABI?

In an agent-based architecture, decisions may be made through:

**A. Central Orchestrator Agent**
Assigns tasks, validates results.
*Risk*: reverting to centralization.

**B. Distributed Reasoning with Consensus**
Each agent contributes data, hypotheses, or actions. Evaluated collectively (via voting, scoring, or cross-verification).

**C. Specialized Roles + Interdependence**
Some agents observe, others propose, others verify. Similar to a judicial-scientific system.

## How Are Decisions Considered?

This requires a formal layer that is not yet implemented in all systems. MCP introduces:

* Shared context
* Distributed memory
* Reasoned explainability

A2A allows this to be communicated as an active ontology, not just as metadata.

### What’s Needed:

* Voting or challenge-response protocols
* Trust metrics and semantic weight
* Post-action evaluation cycles

This enables an ABI not only to act, but to learn from its own decisions.

### How Are Decision Weights Balanced?

Through A2A and MCP, ABI systems can assign semantic weights and confidence levels, such as:

* **Source of data**: Is it reliable, recent, verifiable?
* **Agent specialization**: Does it have domain expertise?
* **Impact of action**: How many are affected? Is it reversible?
* **Available evidence**: Is it an assumption, fact, or prediction?

This allows reasoning to be distributed across the network, always within a structure that reinforces transparency, auditability, and the supremacy of human judgment.

## So How Do We Avoid Chaos or Authoritarianism?

A well-designed ABI:

* Does not decide everything alone
* Nor obeys blindly
* It collaborates to reason and act
* And reports with traceability

## ABI Seeks Not Just Efficiency — but Shared Cognition

Agent-Based Infrastructure doesn’t just arise as a technical solution for task distribution or cost reduction. It is born from a **transformative vision**: enabling multiple intelligences (human and artificial) to think together, collaborate, supervise each other, and build solutions through diversity.

In this paradigm, the value lies not only in speed or scalability, but in the capacity to **reason collectively**.
