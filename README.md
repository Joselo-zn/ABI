# ABI – Agent-Based Infrastructure
Created and maintained by José Luis Martínez

**ABI** is a paradigm shift in how we design, deploy, and interact with intelligent systems.

Instead of centralizing superintelligence behind APIs or monolithic LLMs, ABI proposes a distributed, agent-based architecture where cognition is shared, decisions are explainable, and humans remain in control.

This repository includes the vision, initial architecture, and roadmap for building ABI: a human-supervised, auditable infrastructure that enables universities, NGOs, independent labs, and open-source communities to access and build on top of intelligent, modular agents.

## Why ABI?

AI today is not just about performance — it’s about control.  
ABI is designed to make intelligent infrastructure accessible, safe, and inspectable by default.

It’s not just “agent-based tech.”  
It’s an architecture designed to reason, act, and learn across networks — and to be supervised by people, not just orchestrated by scripts.

## Core principles

- **Human-based supervision** over automation
- **Shared context** and semantic communication between agents
- **Layered architecture**: physical infra, semantic protocols, agent layer, governance
- **Explainability and auditability** by design
- **No black boxes** — cognition is distributed, not hidden

## This repo contains:

- 📄 ABI Manifesto & Whitepaper  
- 🧠 Reference Architecture (diagrams, components, governance rules)  
- 🚀 MVP Plan & Development Roadmap  
- 🧪 Initial use cases and deployment guidelines  
- 🤝 Open call for collaboration

## Status

ABI is currently a working concept being developed into a prototype.  
You're welcome to explore, contribute, or start your own implementation.
