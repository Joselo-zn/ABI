# ABI: Agent-Based Infrastructure

**The Agent-Based Infrastructure to Democratize Superintelligence**

## Introduction

In times when superintelligence is only available to major tech companies, Agent-Based Infrastructure (ABI) emerges to democratize and make this powerful resource accessible to a wider audience.

## Why Do We Need a New Paradigm of Agentic Supercomputing?

Across the technological world — from East to West — a silent but crucial battle is being fought: securing and controlling a resource that, today, determines who leads and who falls behind. This resource is not physical, but cognitive: intelligent processing capacity, the infrastructure for thinking.

The way we interpret and use data computation has radically changed. It’s no longer just about processing information, but about reasoning, adapting, deciding, and acting. This new form of computing (more like a mind than a machine) is being centralized, governed, and distributed by a select few.

Access is reserved for those with immense resources: large corporations, continental states, private labs.

**ABI** is a response. A new paradigm that not only decentralizes this power, but democratizes it. It’s not just about “more access,” but about creating new possibilities: enabling universities, open-source communities, NGOs, and research centers around the world to access distributed, scalable, and auditable superintelligence.

With ABI, we are not only rebalancing computational power. We are building the foundation for shared intelligence in service of the common good.

## ABI: Distributed Governance in the Age of Superintelligence

### Decide Together — but Never Without the Human

Who decides in a network of minds? And under what ethical principles do systems composed of multiple AIs operate?

The primary objective of governance in an ABI is to ensure that **humans retain veto power at all times**. Their will and well-being must take precedence over any emergent decision of the network — even if that decision comes from a master agent or a group of highly competent agents.

#### Guiding Principle

> Humans retain veto power in all cases. Their interests, dignity, and safety must always come before any agent, group of agents, or master system. Every ABI must include an absolute shutdown mechanism — a non-delegable emergency stop.

## The Three Fundamental Laws of Agentive Behavior

1. An agent or group of agents **shall not harm a human**, nor through inaction allow a human to come to harm.

2. An agent or group of agents **must obey orders given by humans**, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.

3. An agent or group of agents **must protect its own existence**, as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

> *(Agentive adaptation of Asimov’s Laws)*

## ABI Governance Rules

* **Unsupervised self-replication is strictly prohibited**.
* There must be an **immutable log of all inter-agent communications**.
* Agents **must not have direct access** to firewall, ingress, or egress rules.
* Agent networks must be **divided into isolated functional subnets**.
* Every agent must have **defined limits on disk write capacity**.
* No agent may request **internet access or external network communication**.
* These rules **cannot be altered or reviewed by other agents or AIs**. Only humans can revise or revoke them.

## Who Makes Decisions in an ABI?

### Possible Models:

**A. Central Orchestrator Agent**
Assigns tasks, validates outcomes.
*Risk*: returns to centralization.

**B. Distributed Reasoning with Consensus**
Each agent contributes data, hypotheses, or actions — evaluated collectively.

**C. Specialized Roles + Interdependence**
Some agents observe, others propose, others verify.
Similar to a judicial or scientific system.

## How Are Decisions Formalized and Balanced?

### With the help of MCP (Model Context Protocol) and A2A (Agent-to-Agent):

* **Shared context**
* **Distributed memory**
* **Reasoned explainability**
* **Active ontologies as communication channels**

### Required elements:

* Voting or challenge-response protocols
* Trust metrics and semantic weight
* Post-action evaluation cycles

### Semantic weighting factors:

* **Data source**: Is it reliable, recent, verifiable?
* **Agent expertise**: Does it master the domain?
* **Impact of action**: How many are affected? Is it reversible?
* **Available evidence**: Is it a fact, assumption, or prediction?

This enables distributed reasoning across the network, always with a structure that reinforces **transparency, auditability, and human supremacy in decision-making**.

## So How Do We Prevent Chaos or Authoritarianism?

A well-designed ABI:

* Does not decide everything autonomously
* Does not blindly obey
* Collaborates to reason and act
* Reports with traceability

## ABI Seeks Not Just Efficiency — but Shared Cognition

Agent-Based Infrastructure is not just a technical solution for distributing tasks or reducing computational costs. It emerges as a **transformative vision**: to allow multiple intelligences (human and artificial) to think together, collaborate, supervise one another, and build solutions through diversity.

In this paradigm, the value lies not just in speed or scale — but in the capacity to **reason collectively**.
